In this paper, we focus on the analysis of a very large class of automated market makers, called constant function market makers (or CFMMs) which includes existing popular market makers such as Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve, whose yearly transaction volume totals to billions of dollars. We give sufficient conditions such that, under fairly general assumptions, agents who interact with these constant function market makers are incentivized to correctly report the price of an asset and that they can do so in a computationally efficient way. We also derive several other useful properties that were previously not known.

These results include the returns and no-arbitrage prices of liquidity pool (LP) shares that investors receive for supplying liquidity to G3Ms. Using these expressions, we show how to create G3Ms whose LP shares replicate the payoffs of financial derivatives. The resulting hedges are model-independent and exact for derivative contracts whose payoff functions satisfy an elasticity constraint. These strategies allow LP shares to replicate various trading strategies and financial contracts, including standard options. G3Ms are thus shown to be capable of recreating a variety of active trading strategies through passive positions in LP shares.")),Object(r.b)("ul",null,Object(r.b)("li",{parentName:"ul"},Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08806"},"Liquidity Provider Returns in Geometric Mean Markets"))),Object(r.b)("h1",{id:"the-replicating-portfolio-of-a-constant-product-market",style:{position:"relative"}},Object(r.b)("a",{parentName:"h1",href:"#the-replicating-portfolio-of-a-constant-product-market","aria-label":"the replicating portfolio of a constant product market permalink",className:"anchor before"},Object(r.b)("svg",{parentName:"a","aria-hidden":"true",focusable:"false",height:"16",version:"1.1",viewBox:"0 0 16 16",width:"16"},Object(r.b)("path",{parentName:"svg",fillRule:"evenodd",d:"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"}))),"The Replicating Portfolio of a Constant Product Market"),Object(r.b)("p",null,"Authors: Joseph Clark"),Object(r.b)("blockquote",null,Object(r.b)("p",{parentName:"blockquote"},"We derive the replicating portfolio of a constant product market.
